# Auction-Website
Auction web appliation created for a PHP/SQL class. Utilizes the full LAMP stack. Not actually intended to be used for actual live transactions.
# Link to the web app (9/22/2017 - decided to attempt to revive this class project from the dead)

Many parts nonfunctioning, as of yet there is no backend setup. Going to do a large refactor as the class project had zero standards.

Currently considering ReactJS/GraphQL/PostgresQL.
